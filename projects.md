# Projects

For many university classes,
we had to work on small projects instead of writing an exam. Even when this normally means much more effort than _"just"_ 
preparing an exam, I am a big fan of this approach. When I actively apply concepts I learn it in more depth and can
remember it for longer.

Many projects were very valuable for me, so that it is worth to present them here.
