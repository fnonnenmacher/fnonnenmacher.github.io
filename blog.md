# Blog

During my short professional life, I, unfortunately, have not worked on public available projects which I can present as 
references. And yes, as a backend guy it would be hard to present my part anyway. However, for many university classes,
we had to work on small projects instead of writing an exam. Even when this normally means much more effort than _"just"_ 
preparing an exam, I am a big fan of this approach. When I actively apply concepts I learn it in more depth and also can
remember it for longer.

Those projects were so valuable for me, that I decided itâ€™s worth to blog about them.
