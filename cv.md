## Education
### 09/2018 - Present | M.Sc. Computer Science – Cloud Computing & Services <br /> _EIT Digital Master School_ (TU Delft & Université 1 Rennes)

The [EIT Digital Master School](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/) is a Master's degree program that is conducted in two different European universities. I've decided on the specialization _Cloud Computing and Services_ and spend the first year at Université 1 Rennes in France. Currently, I am writing my Master's thesis at TU Delft in the Netherlands.

Additionally to the technical classes, this program also has a strong focus on _Innovation & Entrepreneurship_. Part of the program was, for example, a two-week Summer School in Stockholm. Within an international team, we developed and pitched there a potential startup idea.

### 10/2012 - 09/2015 | B.Eng. Computer Science – IT Automotive <br/> _Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University Stuttgart (Germany)_

The [dual study concept](https://www.dhbw-stuttgart.de/zielgruppen/international-visitors/overview/) combines academic learning with workplace training. While studying, I was also employed at the “Robert Bosch GmbH”. Accompanied by the general bachelor's studies, I completed multiple trainings and internships within different departments of the Bosch Group.

These internships allowed me to apply the theoretical concepts in practice and helped me to understand how big companies operate. Furthermore, I did one of the internships at a Bosch location in Curitiba (Brazil) which was especially personally and culturally rewarding.

## Work Experience
### 08/2017 – 08/2018 | Product Owner <br /> _Bosch Software Innovations GmbH, Waiblingen (Germany)_

Together with other Bosch business areas, we developed a cloud-based [platform for different connected vehicle use cases](https://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/products-and-services/mobility-services/vehicle-management-solution/) during the whole life-cycle of a vehicle. This use cases included, for example, administrating the connected fleet and measuring different vehicle data (e. g. CAN data) remotely.

As _Product Owner_ in a SAFe-like project organization, my main task was to coordinate the development activity of the eight-member backend team. Besides the creation, prioritization, presentation, and approval of user-stories, this also included the management of non-functional requirements. Additionally, I was the central interface to internal customers and project partners and collaborated with them on defining the roadmap and several system-level concepts, for example, on architecture aspects, service management, and security.

### 10/2015 - 07/2017 |	(Junior) Cloud Software Developer <br /> _Bosch Software Innovations GmbH, Waiblingen (Germany)_ 

In the first two years of my professional career, I worked in the same project as described above but in a different role. As a member of a self-organized and agile team, we developed a new cloud-based system. We decided on a microservice-based architecture and developed the individual services by using Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Cloudfoundry, and the [Bosch IoT Suite](https://www.bosch-iot-suite.com).

Besides the design and implementation of the system, this also included setting-up a _Continuous Delivery_ pipeline with Junit, Spock, Jenkins and Gradle.
