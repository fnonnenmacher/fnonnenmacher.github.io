# About Me

Hi, I am Fabian, 26 years old and from Germany. After my first job, I decided to do a European Master's program with a specialization on _Cloud Computing_ to expand my knowledge and to grow personally. I will graduate in summer and are therefore searching for a new job as a Software developer or consultant from September onwards.

I am especially interested in modern software development and architecture. On the one hand, I am fascinated by modern technologies and tools which support us to develop better software. On the other hand, I am convinced that the organizational and business aspects are at least as important as the technologies we are using. Only in encouraging environments with a mindset focused on business value we can deliver beneficial software.
