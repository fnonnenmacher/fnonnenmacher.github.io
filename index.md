# About Me

Hi, I am Fabian Nonnenmacher, 26 years old and from Germany. After my first job, I decided to do a European Master's program with a specialization on _Cloud Computing_ to expand my knowledge and to grow personally. I will graduate in summer and are therefore searching for a new job as a software developer (or consultant) from September onwards especially focusing on designing and developing distributed cloud-based applications. 

I am especially interested in modern software development and architecture. On the one hand, I am fascinated by modern technologies and tools which support us to develop better software. On the other hand, I am convinced that the organizational and business aspects are at least as important as the technologies we are using. Only in encouraging environments with a mindset focused on the business value, we can deliver good software and create a benefit for our customers and users.

In 2014, I was living three months in Brazil for an internship. For me, this was the first time leaving Europe and I directly became a travel addict. Since then, I try to spend my yearly holidays abroad travelling to get to know new places and cultures. I enjoy meeting people from all over the world, which also was an important reason for doing an international Master's studies.
