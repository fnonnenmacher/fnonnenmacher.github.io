# Welcome

Hi, I am Fabian, 26 years old and from Germany. After my first job, I decided to do a European Master's program with a specialization on _Cloud Computing_ to expand my knowledge and to grow personally. I will graduate in summer and are therefore searching for a new job as a Software developer or consultant from September onwards.

I am especially interested in modern software development and architecture. On the one hand, I am fascinated by modern technologies and tools which support us to develop better software. On the other hand, I am convinced that the organizational and business aspects are at least as important as the technologies we are using. Only with an agile mindset in encouraging environments, we can deliver the best value for our customers.

To make the application process for recruiters and HR simple, my goal is to hand in documents that are as specific and precise as possible. I am aware that this means there is not enough space to explain all the background information people might be interested in. Therefore, I am using this webpage to [present myself](/about-me) in more detail and to show you a small [portfolio](/blog) of my projects.
