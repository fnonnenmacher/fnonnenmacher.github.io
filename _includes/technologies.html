               Thanks to the Code Reviews and feedback of my senior colleagues I quickly could improve my programming
               skills and could  adapt many best practices (e.g. from Effective Java and Clean Code)."

               value="I like Groovy as a light-weight alternative to Java. I often use it for prototyping and to write
               short scripts. During my job we used Groovy with Spock to write end-to-end tests for our microservices
               and to write Gradle scripts and plugins for our <i>Continuous Delivery</i> pipeline."

               Besides learning Scala, this class also enabled me to think and program in a more functional way. So at the
               end it also helped me to write better Java code.
               At the moment, during my <a href=/projects/masterthesis/> Master's thesis</a>, I extend Spark with new functionality by using Scala."

               coursera class</a> of JetBrains,
               I could pick up most of the concepts easily, because I knew already Groovy and Scala.
               For me Kotlin is a nice alternative to Java. On the one hand it is compatible to most libraries and on the
               other hand through it's modern syntax it allows to write very concise code.
               So far I have not used it for bigger projects, only for small university assignments."
